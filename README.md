Our dataset is the Soco finger dataset with 6000 fingerprint images ,from 600 subjects.
There are 10 fingerprints per subject.
What is our plans?:
We would like to develop 3 models for detect the following things(if we have time we
would like to merge these three models into one model to calculate these things
simultaneously).:

-Fingerprint recognition: Categorize fingerprints that they identity is between the
list of acceptable persons or not.

-Gender predicting: Decide that the finger belong to a male of a female
   
-Finger detection: Decide which finger is which finger (thumb, index, middle, ring,
little)
